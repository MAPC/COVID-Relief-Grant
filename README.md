# COVID-Relief-Grant

MAPC assisted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) administer a grant program for community foundations providing COVID-19
relief within their service area. 

This script synthesizes publicly available data sources to score community foundations' grant applications in terms of level of poverty in area served, pandemic public 
health impact on area served, pandemic economic impact on area served, and presence of gateway municpalities or municipalities with above-average low-income population
or population with limited English-speaking ability. Independent of the scoring method in this script, the DHCD also evaluates community foundation applications in terms of 
other factors through independent means.

The script was evaluated using Python 3.7.7, numpy 1.18.1, and pandas 1.0.3.
